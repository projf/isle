# Isle Earthrise 2D Drawing Engine

The **Earthrise** module [[verilog src](../earthrise.v)] is a simple processor that decodes and executes graphics instructions for pixels, lines, triangles, rects, and circles.

This document provides a summary of the hardware module. See [Earthrise Programming](../../../docs/earthrise-programming.md) for drawing pixels, lines, and shapes. 

See the [2D Drawing](http://projectf.io/isle/2d-drawing.html) blog post for more information on the use of this module.
