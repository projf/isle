# Isle Projects

Example Isle projects.

## Graphics Hardware

[Hitomezashi](hitomezashi) races the beam to create a stitch pattern, which appears both ordered and random. Build by editing `top_ch01.v` to use `hitomezashi` in place of `ch01` then run ch01 make or build.tcl.

[Starfield](starfield) is a simple animated starfield based on a [linear-feedback shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register). Build by editing `top_ch01.v` to use `starfield` in place of `ch01` then run ch01 make or build.tcl.
